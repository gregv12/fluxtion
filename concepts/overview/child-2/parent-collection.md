# Parent collection

## Introduction

The goal is to store a set of parent node references and interact with them meaningfully.

Sometimes we want to manage a set of nodes as a collection and not as scalar values. Fluxtion supports both collections and arrays of parent nodes. Any graph node that is a member of a collection or an array in a managed node will be assigned in the generated SEP at construction time.

The `@OnEvent` method of the aggregating class will be invoked after all parents on the execution path have been updated.

### Parent change identification

Sometimes it is useful to know which element of a collection has updated. The same logic that Fluxtion supports for identifying scalar [parent changes](parent-source-identification.md) works for collections of nodes. Use the `@OnParentUpdate` annotation to mark a method for callback notification, the method should accept a single argument. The argument is a reference to the element in the collection that has just updated. 

Because the notification is connected to a collection, multiple invocations of the `@OnParentUpdate` may occur in a single event cycle, once for each element updated.

If multiple collections of the same type are to be tracked, the value on the `@OnParentUpdate` annotation can be used to route identifications to a specific method monitoring method. Specify the field name of the collection on the callback method to force the routing of notifications. 

## Example

In this example a node has two collections of parent nodes, and both are tracked independently for update notifications. One collection is a list, the other an array. We use the `@OnParentUpdate` annotaton on two methods with a value pointing to the member field we wish to monitor.

The example is available [here](https://github.com/v12technology/fluxtion/tree/develop/examples/documentation-examples/src/main/java/com/fluxtion/example/core/events/collections).

### Aggregating class

Because the class types of the collections intersect we direct the handlers array to a specific method. The routing logic uses the value of the `parentUpdated()` annotation to match the source collection variable name to a handler. 

In this case the Object array\(line 3\) updates will be directed to the `parentUpdated` method on line 12, because line 12 filters for the field "handler", otherwise both member collections would be routed to this method.

The listener on line 15 has no intersecting types only one collection of that type is in the class so automatic resolution will work as expected.

```java
public class Aggregator {

    private final Object[] handlers;
    private final List<ConfigHandler> cfgHandlers;

    public Aggregator(Object[] handlers, List<ConfigHandler> cfgHandlers) {
        this.handlers = handlers;
        this.cfgHandlers = cfgHandlers;
    }

    @OnParentUpdate("handlers")
    public void parentUdated(Object parent) {}

    @OnParentUpdate
    public void parentCfgUdated(ConfigHandler parent) {}
    
    @OnEvent
    public void update(){}

}
```

### SEPConfig builder

```java
public class Builder extends SEPConfig {

    @Override
    public void buildConfig() {
        MyEventHandler handler1 = addNode(new MyEventHandler());
        MyEventHandler handler2 = addNode(new MyEventHandler());
        DataEventHandler handler3 = addNode(new DataEventHandler());
        ConfigHandler cfg0 = addNode(new ConfigHandler());
        ConfigHandler cfg1 = addNode(new ConfigHandler());
        ConfigHandler cfg2 = addNode(new ConfigHandler());
        List<ConfigHandler> cfgHandlers = Arrays.asList(cfg1, cfg2);
        Aggregator agg = addNode(new Aggregator(new Object[]{handler1, handler2, handler3, cfg0}, cfgHandlers));
    }

}
```

### Generated SEP

The SEP creates and assigns the collections before any event processing. All parent update monitoring methods are routed as expected and the `Aggregator.onEvent()` method is invoked after all parents on the active execution path have been visited.

```java
public class SampleProcessor implements EventHandler, BatchHandler, Lifecycle {

  //Node declarations
  private final ConfigHandler configHandler_7 = new ConfigHandler();
  private final ConfigHandler configHandler_9 = new ConfigHandler();
  private final ConfigHandler configHandler_11 = new ConfigHandler();
  private final DataEventHandler dataEventHandler_5 = new DataEventHandler();
  private final MyEventHandler myEventHandler_1 = new MyEventHandler();
  private final MyEventHandler myEventHandler_3 = new MyEventHandler();
  private final Aggregator aggregator_13 =
      new Aggregator(
          new Object[] {myEventHandler_1, myEventHandler_3, dataEventHandler_5, configHandler_7},
          Arrays.asList(configHandler_9, configHandler_11));
  //code omitted for clarity

  public void handleEvent(ConfigEvent typedEvent) {
    //Default, no filter methods
    configHandler_7.cfgUpdate(typedEvent);
    aggregator_13.parentUdated(configHandler_7);
    configHandler_9.cfgUpdate(typedEvent);
    aggregator_13.parentCfgUdated(configHandler_9);
    configHandler_11.cfgUpdate(typedEvent);
    aggregator_13.parentCfgUdated(configHandler_11);
    aggregator_13.update();
    //event stack unwind callbacks
    afterEvent();
  }

  public void handleEvent(DataEvent typedEvent) {
    //Default, no filter methods
    dataEventHandler_5.handleEvent(typedEvent);
    aggregator_13.parentUdated(dataEventHandler_5);
    aggregator_13.update();
    //event stack unwind callbacks
    afterEvent();
  }

  public void handleEvent(MyEvent typedEvent) {
    //Default, no filter methods
    myEventHandler_1.handleEvent(typedEvent);
    aggregator_13.parentUdated(myEventHandler_1);
    myEventHandler_3.handleEvent(typedEvent);
    aggregator_13.parentUdated(myEventHandler_3);
    aggregator_13.update();
    //event stack unwind callbacks
    afterEvent();
  }

}

```
