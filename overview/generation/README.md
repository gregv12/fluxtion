# Generation output control

## Introduction

Sometimes it is desirable to change the style of the code that is generated by Fluxtion without affecting the behaviour of the event processing. Fluxtion offers several configuration options to alter the output, the options include:

* Inject naming strategy for providing auto-generated node names
* Inject naming strategy for providing auto-generated filter names
* Change the template file used to generate SEP
* Change the limit to swap filtered switch for map based dispatch
* Map class names from one type to another
* Declare nodes as public scope
