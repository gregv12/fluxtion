## Introduction

Thanks for dropping by, hope we can persuade you to donate your time to investigate Fluxtion further.

Fluxtion is a fully featured java based event stream processor that brings real-time data processing inside your application. If you need to build applications that react to complex events and make fast decisions then Fluxtion is for you. We build stream processing logic free from any messaging layer, there is no lock-in with Fluxtion.

Fluxtion is is easy to use and ultra fast, our sweet spot is either edge processing or single server applications. Whether you need to process tens of millions of events per second or write complex rule driven applications that make decisions in microseconds we can help. Retro fitting real-time calculations into an existing application without requiring wholesale changes to the infrastructure is a great fit. When you need to make decisions and not just calculate then you are in the right place.

Uniquely among stream processors Fluxtion employs ahead of time compilation to create a stream processing engine. Describe your processing and Fluxtion tailors a solution to your needs at build time. Ahead of time compilation offers several critical advantages over existing products,

* Ultra fast [sub-microsecond response times](http://fluxtion.com/solutions/high-performance-flight-analysis/)
* No vendor lock-in, the engine can be used within any java application
* Compiler optimized code gives higher performance, lower running costs and quicker response times
* Faster startup times for your application
* Integrates client logic as a first class citizen 
* Source code is generated that makes debugging and maintenance easy
* Meta-data such as images and graphml are created to visualise the process graph
