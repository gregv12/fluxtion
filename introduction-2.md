description: A description of Fluxtion's place in the stream processing environment

# Introduction 2

If you are interested in writing real-time or streaming applications we hope to persuade you to investigate Fluxtion further.

Fluxtion is a  routing utility for use within a stream processing application, automatically connecting event streams to processing pipelines. The application is statically analysed by Fluxtion to create an embedded bespoke router. With this approach complex real-time applications can be built more quickly, with less bugs and the end result is optimized to reduce running costs. 

When building an event streaming processing a developer has to answer three questions:

| Question | Answer |
| :--- | :--- |
| **WHAT**  requires processing? | Event streams are the input source to the application  |
| **HOW**  does the input need processing? | Custom written logic or re-used functions |
| **WHEN** does the processing take place? | Bespoke dispatch logic that connects events to streams |
