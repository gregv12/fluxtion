# Introduction 2

Thanks for dropping by if you are interested in writing stream processing applications we hope to persuade you to investigate Fluxtion further.

Fluxtion is a  routing utility for use within a stream processing application. Incoming event streams are automatically connected to processing pipelines. The application is statically analysed  to create a bespoke application dispatcher. Streaming applications can be built more quickly, with less bugs and are optimized to reduce running costs. 

When building an event streaming processing a developer has to answer three questions:

* **WHAT**  requires processing? 
* **HOW**    does the input need processing?
* **WHEN** does the processing take place?

Commonly answered with:

| Question | Answer |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WHAT** | Event streams are the input source to the application  |  |
| **HOW** | Custom written logic or re-used functions |  |
| **WHEN** | Bespoke dispatch logic that connects events to streams |  |
